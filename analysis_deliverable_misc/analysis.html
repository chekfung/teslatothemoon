        <h2>Prediction Task and Metrics for Success</h2>
        <ul class="roman">
          <li>In stock trading, a huge part of algorithmic trading is creating models to determine how particular share prices of companies will change in the future. Since there are near infinite variables that could affect a company’s share price, determining a good model that is able to make the most money is a very difficult problem to solve. In our case, we wanted to focus on a particularly volatile stock, Tesla. The face and CEO of Tesla, Elon Musk, often uses Twitter to announce next steps in Tesla innovation and he has amassed a large online following that talks about the state of Tesla on twitter. The way a CEO acts online often reflects on the company and twitter reactions to Musk and his company may be a quick way to determine how people feel about the company at a certain point in time. Therefore, we wanted to see if Twitter sentiment could be a useful predictor for the Tesla stock. Being successful in this task could increase profitability by being able to account for how Twitter may affect stock price, reducing the unexplained volatility that stems from TSLA stock at this point in time for a particular trader or company.
          </li>
          <li><b>Our prediction task is as follows:</b> Provided Twitter sentiment data and possibly Tesla share price for each hour in the time period of February 6th, 2020, to March 6th, 2020, predict the next price of one TSLA share. 

          <ul class="square">
            <li>For regression, we planned on finding a model that is able to maximize our r_squared values, while minimizing our mean squared error when using a regression model. In addition, we manually will inspect the models to make sure that we are not overfitting or underfitting. We used twitter sentiment scores as our independent variable to predict the movement in the Tesla share price for one time step, which will be the dependent variable. </li>
            <li>In our deep learning model, we plan on using a stock trading simulation where we compare the money made by our RNN prediction given only stock data against our RNN model’s predictions given both stock and Twitter data. In addition, for our RNN we also use mean-square error to evaluate how close our model is to both the training and the testing data.
            </li>
          </ul>
          </li>
          <li>For both models, the objective is to make as much money as possible. Our goal of minimizing mean-square error helps this objective because a more accurate prediction allows for being able to correctly predict the direction of a stock, allowing our models to make more money.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How Were the ML Algorithm and Metrics for Success Determined?</h2>
        <h3><a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1SEUtaLe4FjCH_RIAvaJf6DHhT97-QiI0?usp=sharing">Link to Python Scripts Used</a></h2> 
        <ul class="roman">
          <li>We used many different kinds of regression when implementing regression to test exactly which ones would work the best. In our case, we tested linear regression, polynomial regression of degree 2, polynomial regression of degree 3, and support vector regression between the twitter sentiment data and the stock price for each hour between our time period.
          </li>
          <li>We first took our sentiment data and preprocessed it so that it fit the time frame of our stock data. That is, our twitter sentiment score for each hour was compiled based off on: Σ polarity * (favorites + retweets + quotes + reply). Second, for non trading hours and weekends we had to take the average sentiment of all hours in between to aggregate into one data point. Third, we also had to pair each hour’s Twitter data with the appropriate stock data point using the dates of each data point. After that, we got rid of outliers in the sentiment data. We believed that the outliers would skew our prediction models for regression, so we got rid of them to try and get a better model in the specific region that we had data in. We define outliers as any point where the twitter sentiment has a z-score of above 3.00 or below 3.00. In all of our data, we found that the mean twitter sentiment was 21.18 and the standard deviation was 45.40. With z-score bounds of -3 and 3, we find that the bottom and top bound of sentiment are -115 and 157, respectively. In addition, we split our data into training and testing data, where testing accounts for 20 percent of the data.
          </li>
          <li>For regression we measure success or failure based on mean_squared_error, r_squared values and whether the model overfit or underfit. We chose r_squared because that tells us how well our model explains for variance in the dependent variable. We chose mean_squared_error because it tells us how much error there was in our model, as well as if we are underfitting or overfitting. At first, we found that most of our data was clustered around sentiments of zero, but we had a few outliers that affected our model greatly. After getting rid of the outliers, all of the regression models we tested seemed to approximate a linear model.
          </li>
          <li>Despite the fact that we are able to minimize our testing mean squared error better on these more complex models, it seems that we are overfitting to hit more points in our data (see figures below). Therefore, we evaluate the linear model as the best model for relating the two variables, $TSLA share price and twitter sentiment together.
          </li>
          <li>We had two RNN models, one given Twitter sentiment data along with stock data, and one with just stock data. For the RNN models, we wrote a trading script that aimed to make money using RNN predictions for stock price. We therefore measure success for the RNN models to be the difference in money made between the RNN with only stock data and the RNN with stock data and Twitter data. For example, if the RNN with stock and Twitter data outperformed the RNN with only stock data, we would be able to say Twitter sentiment can help predict TSLA stock prices. We also choose to measure the performance of the RNN models by their mean_squared_error. We chose to use profit as a measure because it easily tells us if the RNN can make correct predictions and if the RNN with Twitter data significantly outperforms the RNN without Twitter data. We also chose mean_squared_error because it allows us to compare RNNs with our regression models, and it provides a measure of error in our predictions.
          </li>
          <li>We had several challenges. First, because we were only able to gather one month of Twitter data due to the Twitter API, we may simply have gotten a poor sample, and there may not be enough data to make a conclusion off of. Next, we found the RNN took significantly more time to write and train than we had planned for, and for this deliverable, we decided it would not make sense to include an unfinished or minimally trained model. Finally, we realized there was an inherent flaw in predicting stock prices using Twitter data during non trading hours: because of stock futures trading, even after trading ends on one day, people may have a good sense of where TSLA will open the next day, which could affect Twitter sentiment during those hours. Therefore, by using the average of all Twitter sentiment during all after trading hours to predict the opening stock price on the next day, we may be using Twitter sentiment that has already reacted to the open stock price predicted by futures trading, which could skew results.
          </li>
          <li>When evaluating our regression models, we found that all of them do not have great r_squared values, implying that twitter sentiment data does not seem to affect the stock price of TSLA. There does not seem to be a high correlation between the two.

        </ul>

        <h2>Interpretation of Results</h2>
        <ul class="roman">
          <li>The linear regression model did not fit the data very well as evidenced by the small R_squared. Therefore, our prediction accuracy is not as good as we had hoped. Using the RNN in the future, we hope to improve our prediction accuracy.
          </li>
          <li>We believe our regression model had a lackluster prediction accuracy because other confounding factors like previous stock price are also relevant while our regression only took into account twitter sentiment at a specific point in time. This resulted in a distribution that looked vaguely uniform and random indicating that linear regression with these variables will not be very useful. We found that the r_squared value was quite low, with a testing MSE on the linear regression of -0.16. We believe that the correlation between the two variables is minimal, but it is important to note that we cannot be that confident in our results due to our data collection. Since we were not able to capture more tweets due to Twitter API limitations, our dataset was much smaller, meaning that there is a chance that our data is not able to capture the correlation between our two variables.
          </li>
          <li>Another factor in the performance of the regression model is that not all traders use Twitter and not all people on Twitter who comment about Tesla trade stocks. This means that we are using data from one population, Twitter users, for use in predicting the behavior of another population, people who trade stocks when these populations aren’t the same.</li>

          <p class="caption"><strong>Figure 2:</strong> MSE and R_squared for Regression Analyses
          <br>
          <li>Preliminary results using an RNN shows that it seems to overfit heavily on the training data, while seeming to perform worse on the testing data over time. Training MSE did decrease over time, but testing MSE was increasing over time. This seems to suggest that our model’s architecture needs to be changed in some way to prevent this overfitting.

        <br>

        <h2>Visualizations</h2>
        <ul class="roman">
          <li>For visualization, we decided to use a time series graph of TSLA price and Twitter sentiment. We thought this would be useful because it makes it easy to see how TSLA price and Twitter sentiment move together. Next, we used a scatter plot of Twitter Sentiment vs TSLA price, which we thought would easily display any trend or correlation between the two. Since we were using these variables as our dependent and independent variables, respectively, it made sense to use these graphs to initially display the raw data alongside our predicted model.
          </li>
          <li>Our graphs are regression models (linear, polynomial(degree 2 and 3), and SVR) attempting to predict TSLA stock price solely from twitter sentiment data.
          </li>
          <li>Our linear regression produced a line with a small slope, low r_squared, and high MSE. The polynomial regression models (second and third degree) we used created trends that mirrored our linear regression model, but due to the complexity of the model overfit to the data more, leading us to believe our linear model is the most useful.
          </li>
          <li>One of the challenges visualizing our results was the presence of outliers which affected our regression analysis. We removed values with a z-score bigger than 3. We found that 5 of our points were outliers. After removing these, our data seemed to be very uniformly random, suggesting that there is not a correlation between the two variables.
          </li>
          <li>We plan on improving our visualizations for the final poster. For the analysis deliverable, we included bare bones visualizations to showcase the progress we have made and to explain our results. For our final poster, we will make the visualizations more appealing and accessible. Additionally, we will have more visualizations once our RNN is finished.</li>

        <h2>Why We Chose Regression and RNN</h2>
        <ul class="roman">
          <li>For regression, we had tried out multiple different types of regression: linear, polynomial of degree 2, polynomial of degree 3, and support vector regression. All of the more complex models seem to boil down to a linear model, but have multiple different lines to fit more to the training data. For regression, we choose a linear model because it is able to approximate as good if not better than the more complex models, but does not overfit as much. Our data does not have any protected attributes that we know of. In addition, we will update the visualizations to look more visually appealing in the final poster. At this moment in time, we wanted to get the information down first and adjust our plots to be pretty later on since we believed that having substance was more important at this point in the project.
          </li>
          <li>In the future, we plan on using a deep learning RNN model as well because they learn to use data they have seen in the past to predict the next stock price. For the stock market, this intuitively makes sense because stock prices many hours in the past may contribute to how the current price will move. While we have not explicitly included it in this deliverable, we have already written a simulation trading script given the predicted RNN stock price graph are actively testing and tweaking our RNN to get the best results possible. We plan on using these visualizations in our poster to demonstrate how there is not really much correlation between the TSLA stock price and twitter sentiment, but it could be one small factor in a group of many different factors that influence Tesla's stock price. The trading script will allow us to evaluate how are model has trained in the future and provide us visualizations of many different models.
